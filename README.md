# AQ-Video-Compressor
Ever have a bulk of videos just sitting around your PC taking enormous amounts of space, use this tool to easily compress them without a lot of effort/hassle!

The recent MAUI .NET 6 has been used to make the application and for the video conversions FFMpeg and FFMpegCore wrapper has been utilized. It has also been made to take advantage of NVENC, for those who have Nvidia GPUs.

The compression presets can also be selected via the app, as well as CPU threads being used can be reduced to make it less performance intensive.
